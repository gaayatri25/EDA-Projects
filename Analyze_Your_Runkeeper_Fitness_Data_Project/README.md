# Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data

Import, clean, and analyze seven years worth of training data tracked on the Runkeeper app. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. 


*This project is a premium project from DataCamp to let us apply our skills using tools like Jupyter Notebook and complete a data analysis from start to finish.
